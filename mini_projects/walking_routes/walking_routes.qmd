## Introduction

I have highly idiosyncratic preferences when it comes to my exercise routine. 
I like to 
walk or run outdoors in a closed loop of a pre-determined length with minimal
backtracking on the same roads. In this post I develop an equally idiosyncratic
algorithm to generate candidate routes for my runs. I incorporate ideas from
graph/network theory and Geographic Information Systems to generate routes 
satisfying my criteria.
