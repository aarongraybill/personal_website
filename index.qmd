::: {intro-text}
Hi, I'm Aaron! I'm a senior research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. I work with [Kyle Mangum](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/kyle-mangum) on applied microeconomics.

I graduated magna cum laude from Haverford College in 2022 with majors in economics and mathematics and a minor in statistics. My [undergraduate thesis](assets/Graybill_Undergraduate_Thesis.pdf) constructed a theoretical model to understand how "the algorithm" affects content creators' decisions to produce media.

My research interests lie at the intersection of social science and technology. I hope to contribute to research on misinformation, radicalization on social media, and the impacts of digital media on consumer welfare.

I'm the author of [ggchameleon](https://github.com/aarongraybill/ggchameleon), an R package that takes the headache out of making consistent-looking professional ggplots.

You can download a copy of my CV [here](assets/Graybill_Resume_2023_10.pdf).

Outside of research, I have a rotating cast of hobbies including film photography and development, recreational mathematics, various coding projects, and guitar.
