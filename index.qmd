::: {intro-text}
Hi, I'm Aaron! I'm a research associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. I work with [Kyle Mangum](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/kyle-mangum) on applied microeconomics. In the fall, I will be starting a quantitative marketing PhD at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

My research interests lie at the intersection of social science and technology. I hope to contribute to research on misinformation, digital privacy legislation, and the creator economy.

I'm the author of [ggchameleon](https://github.com/aarongraybill/ggchameleon), an R package that takes the headache out of making consistent-looking professional ggplots.

Here is a link to [my CV](cv).

Outside of research, I have a rotating cast of hobbies including film photography and development, recreational mathematics, various coding projects, and guitar.
